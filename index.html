  <h1>CANCER</h1>
  <h2>The Definition of Cancer</h2>
  <p><b>Cancer</b> is a disease in which some of the body's cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body.</p><p>Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body,which is made up of trillions of cells.Normally,human cells grow and multiply(through a process called <i>Cell Division</i>)to form new cells as the body needs them.When cells grow old or become damaged,they die,and new cells take their place.Sometimes this orderly process breaks down,and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn't.These cells may form tumors,which are lumps of tissue.Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous(benign).Cancerous tumors spread into,or invade,nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors(a process called <b>metastasis</b>).Cancerous tumors may also be called <i>malignant tumors</i>.Many cancers form solid tumors,but cancers of the blood ,such as<em> leukemias </em>generally do not.</p>
  <h2>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CANCER CELLS AND NORMAL CELLS</h2>
  <p>Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways.For instance,cancer cells:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
     <li>Grow in the absence of signals telling them to grow.Normal cells only grow when they receive such signals.</li>
     <li>Ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or to die(a process known as <u>programmed cell death,or apoptosis</u>).</li>
     <li>Invade into nearby areas and spread to other areas of the body.Normally cells stop growing when they encounter other cells,and most normal cells do not move around the body.</li>
     <li>Tell blood vessels to grow toward tumors.These blood vessels supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products from tumors.</li>
     <li>Hide from the immune system.The immune system normally eliminates damaged or abnormal cells .</li>
     <li>Trick the immune system into helping cancer cells stay alive and grow.For instance,some cancer cells convince immune cells to protect the tumor instead of attacking it.</li>
     <li>Accumulate multiple changes in their chromosome,such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts.Some cancer cells have double the normal number of chromosomes.</li>
     <li>Rely on different kinds of nutrients than normal cells.In addition,some cancer cells make energy from nutrients in a different way than most normal cells.This lets cancer cells grow more quickly.</li>
   <h2>HOW DOES CANCER DEVELOP?</h2>
  <P>Cancer is a <b>genetic disease</b>-that is,it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function,especially how they grow and divide.</p>
